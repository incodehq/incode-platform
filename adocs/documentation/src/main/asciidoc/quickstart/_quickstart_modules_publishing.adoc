Publishing and commands share some similarities: both create an XML representation of an action invocation or property edit.
However, whereas a Command represents only the _intention_ to invoke the action, with publishing the serialized XML also captures the result of the invocation and some basic metrics.

The main use case of publishing is to be able facilitate message exchange between external systems.
The quickstart app uses the xref:../modules/spi/publishmq/spi-publishmq.adoc#[publishmq] module which bootstraps an in-memory ActiveMQ instance and publishes to it.

In fact, the publishmq module allows the location of the ActiveMQ queue to be overridden.
The quickstart app configures these properties, but leaves them as their defaults (that is, connecting to an in-memory ActiveMQ instance):

[source,ini]
.isis.properties (in webapp module)
----
isis.services.PublisherServiceUsingActiveMq.vmTransportUri=vm://broker
isis.services.PublisherServiceUsingActiveMq.memberInteractionsQueue=\
                                                           memberInteractionsQueue
----

The quickstart app (when using the fixtures) disables publishing "globally" in the app manifest:

[source,ini]
.DomainAppAppManifestWithFixtures (in the appdefn module)
----
protected void disableAuditingAndCommandAndPublishGlobally(final Map<String, String> configurationProperties) {
    ...
    configurationProperties.put("isis.services.publish.objects","none");
    configurationProperties.put("isis.services.publish.actions","none");
    configurationProperties.put("isis.services.publish.properties","none");
}
----

but the `SimpleObject` domain object re-enables publishing for both editing of the `notes` property:

[source,java]
----
@Property(
        ...
        publishing = Publishing.ENABLED
)
private String notes;
----

and for invoking the `updateName` action:

[source,java]
----
@Action(
        ...
        publishing = Publishing.ENABLED
)
public SimpleObject updateName( ... ) {  ... }
----

Using the link:http:http://hawt.io[hawt.io] console we can monitor the messages sent to the ActiveMQ message.
Download the hawt.io JAR file and start using:

[source,bash]
----
java -jar hawtio-app-1.5.3.jar --port 9090
----

Then connect to the jolokia servlet (configured in the quickstart's `web.xml`):

image::{_imagesdir}modules/publish/hawtio-jolokia-connect.png[width="600px",link="{_imagesdir}modules/publish/hawtio-jolokia-connect.png"]

with the port set to `8080` and the path set to `/api/jolokia`.

Invoking the `updateName` action on `SimpleObject` will result in a message being sent to the ActiveMQ queue:

image::{_imagesdir}modules/publish/hawtio-activemq-interactions.png[width="600px",link="{_imagesdir}modules/publish/hawtio-activemq-interactions.png"]

and indeed the details of the message can be inspected:

image::{_imagesdir}modules/publish/hawtio-activemq-interaction.png[width="600px",link="{_imagesdir}modules/publish/hawtio-activemq-interaction.png"]

[NOTE]
====
Note that these are only visible via hawt.io because there is nothing consuming the messages.
For that, you need to configure a consumer,
The xref:quickstart-with-embedded-camel.adoc#[embedded camel] extended example does precisely this.
====


The publishmq module also persists all interactions to a database table; this is to allow messages to be resent if required.
The message can be seen persisted as a `PublishedEvent` entity (searchable from the _Activity_ menu):

image::{_imagesdir}modules/publish/publish-object.png[width="600px",link="{_imagesdir}modules/publish/publish-object.png"]
