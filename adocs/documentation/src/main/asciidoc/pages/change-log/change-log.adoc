The Incode Platform combines the modules previously available as part of link:http://isisaddons.org[Isis Addons] and the link:http://catalog.incode.org[Incode Catalog].
Whereas previously these modules each resided in their own git repo and were released separately, the modules in the platform all reside in a single git repo and are released together.

This page collates the change logs from the individual modules both collectively (as part of the platform) and previously.
