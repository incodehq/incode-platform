All of these modules define their own set of persistent entities and supporting services.

| xref:commchannel/dom-commchannel.adoc#[Comm Channel]
| Provides the ability to attach communication channel objects (postal address, email or phone/fax number) to arbitrary domain entities.
There are _no_ requirements for those objects to implement any interfaces.

| xref:../wkt/gmap3/gmap3.adoc#[gmap3] (optional)


|xref:communications/dom-communications.adoc#[Communications]
| Defines ``CommunicationChannel``s (email address, postal address or phone/fax number), and also allows (xref:../../dom/document/dom-document.adoc#[Document]'s) ``Document``s to be sent as ``Communication``s either to an email address or to a postal address.

[NOTE]
====
This currently does _not_ use the communication channels defined by xref:commchannel/dom-commchannel.adoc#[Comm Channel].
The intention is to unify these modules at some point in the future.
