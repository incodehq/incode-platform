This module (`isis-module-sessionlogger`) provides an implementation of Apache Isis' `SessionLoggingService` API that persists session entries (representing users logging in or out of the application) using Isis' own (JDO) objectstore.
Typically this will be to a relational database; the module's `SessionLogEntry` entity is mapped to the "IsisSessionLogEntry" table.


== Screenshots

[NOTE]
====
The screenshots below *do* demonstrate the functionality of this module, but are out of date in that they are taken from the original isisaddons/incodehq module (prior to being amalgamated into the incode-platform).
====

The sessionlogger module automatically creates log entries whenever a user logs on or logs out.
The currently logged on users of the application (that is: those for whom there is a valid non-expired HTTP session) can be found from the activity menu:

image::{_imagesdir}010-active-sessions.png[width="600px",link="{_imagesdir}010-active-sessions.png"]


In the screenshot below there are two currently active users:

image::{_imagesdir}020-active-sessions-listed.png[width="600px",link="{_imagesdir}020-active-sessions-listed.png"]


The module also allows current and previously active sessions to be searched for:

image::{_imagesdir}030-find-sessions.png[width="600px",link="{_imagesdir}030-find-sessions.png"]


The list of sessions can optionally be filtered by user and date range:

image::{_imagesdir}040-find-sessions-prompt.png[width="600px",link="{_imagesdir}040-find-sessions-prompt.png"]



returning matching sessions:

image::{_imagesdir}050-find-sessions-listed.png[width="600px",link="{_imagesdir}050-find-sessions-listed.png"]


== How to Configure/Use

=== Classpath

Update your classpath by adding this dependency in your project's `dom` module's `pom.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.isisaddons.module.sessionlogger</groupId>
    <artifactId>isis-module-sessionlogger-dom</artifactId>
    <version>1.15.0</version>
</dependency>
----

Check for releases by searching http://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|isis-module-sessionlogger-dom[Maven Central Repo].

For instructions on how to use the latest `-SNAPSHOT`, see the xref:../../../pages/contributors-guide.adoc#[contributors guide].


=== Bootstrapping

In the `AppManifest`, update its `getModules()` method, eg:

[source,java]
----
@Override
public List<Class<?>> getModules() {
    return Arrays.asList(
        ...
        org.isisaddons.module.sessionlogger.SessionLoggerModule.class,
        ...
    );
}
----



== API

The `SessionLoggingService` defines the following API:

[source,java]
----
public interface SessionLoggingService {
    public enum Type {
        LOGIN,
        LOGOUT
    }
    public enum CausedBy {
        USER,
        SESSION_EXPIRATION,
        RESTART
    }
    void log(Type type, String username, Date date, CausedBy causedBy);
}
----

The framework will automatically call the `log(...)` method on the service implementation if configured to run the Wicket viewer.

[NOTE]
====
The framework only ever calls `log(...)` with a `CausedBy` value of either "USER" (the user has explicitly logged in
or logged out), or with "SESSION_EXPIRATION" (the Wicket viewer session has timed out).

The "RESTART" value is provided for implementations (such as the xref:../../spi/sessionlogger/spi-sessionlogger.adoc#[sessionlogger spi] module) which automatically "tidy-up" and mark as complete and sessions that were in-progress if the webserver is restarted.
====



== Implementation

The `SessionLoggingService` API is implemented in this module by the `org.isisaddons.module.sessionlogger.SessionLoggingServiceDefault` class.
This implementation simply inserts a session log entry (`SessionLogEntry`) when either a user logs on, logs out or if their session expires.

The `SessionLogEntry` properties directly correspond to parameters of the `SessionLoggingService` `log()` API:

[source,java]
----
public class SessionLogEntry
    ...
    private String sessionId;                           // <1>
    private String username;                            // <2>
    private SessionLoggingService.Type type;            // <3>
    private Timestamp loginTimestamp;                   // <4>
    private Timestamp logoutTimestamp;                  // <5>
    private SessionLoggingService.CausedBy causedBy;    // <6>
    ...
}
----
<1> `sessionId` identifies the user's session. Primary key.
(*Note*: it is not the http session id!)
<2> `username` identifies the user that has logged in/out
<3> `type` determines whether this was a login or logout.
<4> `loginTimestamp` is the date that the login of the session event occurred
<5> `logoutTimestamp` is the date that the logout of the session event occurred
<6> `causedBy`indicates whether the session was logged out due to explicit user action, by session expiry, or by the server restarting

The `SessionLogEntry` entity is designed such that it can be rendered on an Isis user interface if required.



== Supporting Services

As well as the `SessionLoggingServiceDefault` service (that implements the `SessionLoggingService` API), the module also provides two further domain services:

* `SessionLogEntryRepository` provides the ability to search for persisted (`SessionLogEntry`) entries. +
+
None of its actions are visible in the user interface (they are all `@Programmatic`) and so this service is automatically registered.

* `SessionLoggingServiceMenu` provides the secondary "Activity" menu for listing all active sessions and for searching for session entries by user and by date. +
+
The `SessionLoggingServiceMenu` is automatically registered as a domain service; as such its actions will appear in the user interface.
If this is not required, then either use security permissions or write a vetoing subscriber on the
event bus to hide this functionality, eg: +
+
[source,java]
----
@DomainService(nature = NatureOfService.DOMAIN)
public class HideIsisAddonsSessionLoggerFunctionality extends AbstractSubscriber {
    @Subscribe
    public void on(final SessionLoggerModule.ActionDomainEvent<?> event) { event.hide(); }
}
----




== Known issues or Limitations

The Restful Objects viewer currently does not support this service.




== Dependencies

This module has no dependencies other than Apache Isis.



== Related Modules/Services

There is some overlap with the`AuditingService3` API, which audits changes to entities by end-users.
Implementations of this service are referenced by the http://www.isisaddons.org[Isis Add-ons] website.
