This module, intended for use with link:http://isis.apache.org[Apache Isis], provides the ability to attach notes
to arbitrary domain objects.

Each event implements the `CalendarEventable` interface (from link:http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-wicket-fullcalendar2[Fullcalendar2 wicket component]) meaning that they can be rendered in a calendar view.

It also means that each event, when created, belongs to a named calendar (just a string).


== Screenshots

The following screenshots show an example app's usage of the module.

[NOTE]
====
TODO - to document
====



== How to run the Demo App

The prerequisite software is:

* Java JDK 7 (nb: Isis currently does not support JDK 8)
* http://maven.apache.org[maven 3] (3.2.x or later is recommended).

To build the demo app:

[source]
----
git clone https://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-event.git
mvn clean install
----

To run the demo app:

[source]
----
mvn antrun:run -P self-host
----

Then log on using user: `sven`, password: `pass`


== How to configure/use

You can either use this module "out-of-the-box", or you can fork this repo and extend to your own requirements. 

=== "Out-of-the-box"

To use "out-of-the-box":

* update your classpath by adding importing the parent module's dependency into in your parent module's `pom.xml`: +
+
[source,xml]
----
<dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.incode.module.note</groupId>
            <artifactId>isis-module-note-dom</artifactId>
            <version>${isis-module-note.version}</version>
        </dependency>
        ...
    </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
----

* if using `AppManifest`, then update its `getModules()` method:

    @Override
    public List<Class<?>> getModules() {
        return Arrays.asList(
                ...
                org.incode.module.note.NoteModule.class,
        );
    }


* alternatively, in your project's `webapp` module, update your `WEB-INF/isis.properties`. +
+
[source,xml]
----
  isis.services.ServicesInstallerFromAnnotation.packagePrefix=\
                                ...\
                                org.incode.module.note.dom,\
                                ...
----

[NOTE]
====
TODO - can also use AppManifest instead.
====




Notes:

* Check for later releases by searching http://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|isis-module-event-dom[Maven Central Repo]).

==== "Out-of-the-box" (-SNAPSHOT)

If you want to use the current `-SNAPSHOT`, then the steps are the same as above, except:

* when updating the classpath, specify the appropriate -SNAPSHOT version:

[source,xml]
----
<version>1.10.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
----

* add the repository definition to pick up the most recent snapshot (we use the Cloudbees continuous integration service).  We suggest defining the repository in a `<profile>`:

[source,xml]
----
<profile>
    <id>cloudbees-snapshots</id>
    <activation>
        <activeByDefault>true</activeByDefault>
    </activation>
    <repositories>
        <repository>
            <id>snapshots-repo<;/id>
            <url>http://repository-estatio.forge.cloudbees.com/snapshot/</url>
            <releases>
                <enabled>false>/enabled>
            </releases>
            <snapshots>
                <enabled>true</enabled>
            </snapshots>
        </repository>
    </repositories>
</profile>
----


=== Forking the repo

If instead you want to extend this module's functionality, then we recommend that you fork this repo.  The repo is 
structured as follows:

* `pom.xml   ` - parent pom
* `app`        - the demo webapp's `AppManifest`
* `dom       ` - the module implementation, depends on Isis applib
* `fixture   ` - fixtures, holding a sample domain objects and fixture scripts; depends on `dom`
* `integtests` - integration tests for the module; depends on `fixture`
* `webapp    ` - demo webapp (see above screenshots); depends on `dom` and `fixture`

Only the `dom` project is released to Maven Central Repo.  The versions of the other modules are purposely left at 
`0.0.1-SNAPSHOT` because they are not intended to be released.

=== Dependencies

There are no third-party dependencies.

==  Maven deploy notes

Only the `dom` module is deployed, and is done so using Sonatype's OSS support (see
http://central.sonatype.org/pages/apache-maven.html[user guide]).

=== Release to Sonatype's Snapshot Repo

To deploy a snapshot, use:

[source]
----
pushd dom
mvn clean deploy
popd
----

The artifacts should be available in Sonatype's
https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots[Snapshot Repo].



=== Release to Maven Central

The `release.sh` script automates the release process. It performs the following:

* performs a sanity check (`mvn clean install -o`) that everything builds ok
* bumps the `pom.xml` to a specified release version, and tag
* performs a double check (`mvn clean install -o`) that everything still builds ok
* releases the code using `mvn clean deploy`
* bumps the `pom.xml` to a specified release version

For example:

[source]
----
sh release.sh 1.10.0 \
              1.11.0-SNAPSHOT \
              dan@haywood-associates.co.uk \
              "this is not really my passphrase"
----

where
* `$1` is the release version
* `$2` is the snapshot version
* `$3` is the email of the secret key (`~/.gnupg/secring.gpg`) to use for signing
* `$4` is the corresponding passphrase for that secret key.

Other ways of specifying the key and passphrase are available, see the `pgp-maven-plugin`'s
http://kohsuke.org/pgp-maven-plugin/secretkey.html[documentation]).

If the script completes successfully, then push changes:

[source]
----
git push origin master
git push origin 1.10.0
----

If the script fails to complete, then identify the cause, perform a `git reset --hard` to start over and fix the issue
before trying again.  Note that in the `dom`'s `pom.xml` the `nexus-staging-maven-plugin` has the 
`autoReleaseAfterClose` setting set to `true` (to automatically stage, close and the release the repo).  You may want
to set this to `false` if debugging an issue.

According to Sonatype's guide, it takes about 10 minutes to sync, but up to 2 hours to update http://search.maven.org[search].
